## Step 1: Identify a Mascot, Flag, and Theme Song

The first step of any group project is identifying a team name, mascot and flag. Thus, Team Mo' Betta was formed.

## Step 2: Choose a study for replication

We chose to replicate [Spatz et al., (2023), "Tracking the global application of conservation translocation and social attraction to reverse seabird declines"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2214574120). We plan to reproduce figure 4:

*Selection Methods: As a group, we first shared each other's tentative plots with our rationale for why we selected them. We were initially split between how complete and complex the data was and how helpful it was to the user's own research. In the end, it was decided that we would try to select the plot that had sufficient data available but be challenging enough to gain new data organization and plot recreation skills in R.*

## Step 3: Identify and Describe Data

The data and metadata needed to reproduce Figure 4 from Spatz et al., 2023, is described [here](data_description.html).

## Step 4: Create a Written Plan for Computational Analysis

Our written plan for computational analysis is available [here](computational_analysis_plan.html).

## Step 5: Create a Manuscript Documenting Your Process

Our (brief) manuscript documenting the process is available [here](paper.html).
