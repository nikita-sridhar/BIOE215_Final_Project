*In this document, we describe our written plan for computational analysis needed to reproduce Figure 4 from Spatz et al., 2023.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Repository Structure

We will have 5 major folders and several subfolders:

-   **data**

    -   raw_data.csv : raw data downloaded from zenodo

    -   clean_data.csv : cleaned and filtered dataset, ready for plotting

-   **docs**

    -   index.html : main page for our final project

    -   data_description.html : description of data and availability

    -   computational_analysis_plan.html : written description of plan for computational analysis

    -   analysis.html : description and execution of our analysis

-   **reports:** quarto scripts and files associated with html files in the docs folder.

    -   01_cleaning.qmd - cleans the raw dataset and outputs the clean dataset

    -   02_plot.qmd - generates the plot replication of Figure 4.

-   **scripts** (R scripts associated with the working drafts of this project)
